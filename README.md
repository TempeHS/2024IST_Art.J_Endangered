# Documentation

In developing Endangered, a 2D platformer featuring hyper-intelligent endangered animals, I focused on integrating a variety of skills and techniques. This project has significantly contributed to my growth as a game developer, particularly in the areas of game design principles and programming.

I gained proficiency in C#, which was essential for scripting gameplay mechanics such as character movement, damage & respawning, and collision detection. My familiarity with Unity enabled efficient game development and management of assets, streamlining the entire process.

Collaboration was another key aspect of this project; I worked closely with Hughie M. to create cohesive visuals, learning the importance of effective communication within a team.

Overall, the development of Endangered has provided invaluable experience in various aspects of game design and programming. The skills I acquired will significantly contribute to my growth in the industry and make me a strong candidate for future employment opportunities.
